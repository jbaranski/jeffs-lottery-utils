Historical lottery numbers, updated a few hours after every draw.

### Powerball
### Mega Millions
See here for how the game has evolved over time: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_Millions#Versions_of_(The_Big_Game)_Mega_Millions.

`megamillions-pre-10-28-2017.csv` and `megamillions-pre-10-28-2017.json` contain historical data before the current modern game format. I don't actually need or use this, but since I gathered the information I just kept it available here.

`megamillions.csv` and `megamillions.json` contain historical data for the current game format, from *October 28, 2017* to present.
